Here are Cyberfeeder feature ideas I have or received so far. If there are particular demands for some of them, I can bump them up.

**Done in last update**
- Fix Cyberfeeder double-starting in jinteki.net

**Planned for next feature update:**
- Handle Nuvem top deck peek
- Search function in config menu
- Combine style/script tab into one, and add a marker for script feature instead

**Considering positively**
- Recently toggled items collection
- New features collection (updated every major/minor release)
- Add about page
- Fix clock overflow when clock goes over 12:00
- Match history (shows how many times you faced this opponent, and how many days ago you met them recently)
- Highlight for rooms that deviate from default title format
**Requested**
- Zen mode (hide nonessential information, make them appear when mouse is nearby)

**Nice to have, but I don't need it**
- Remove download permission and ask when needed
- Chrome support (it might actually be coming soon, but not from me)
- Interactive configuration page (Like sidebar menu, but visual. Shows toggles over a mock game board)
- Mobile support, also means making a configuration tab (since there is no sidebar in mobile)
- Find out why per-player clock is buggy when spectating and fix it
- Highlights for cards that meet Threat condition
- User custom CSS (you can edit existing styles, or use Stylus)
- Tabletop experience, where click/credits (stat area) look like tokens instead of numbers

**Won't do**
- Make new features announcement page when new features are released (I personally find them annoying when extensions do this)
- User custom script (use Greasemonkey, or make a PR)

**Can't do**
- Make drag and drop work on touch screen (tried to fix this, but could not do it in userscript-land)
