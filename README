This is a firefox extension that adds new scripts and stylesheet into jinteki.net.

The extension shall be:
- Plug and playable.
- Mobile friendly (some day!)
- Good for reading board states intuitively.
- Easy to integrate into jnet.

To develop the extension, see `package.json` for build commands, and corresponding assets and files that generate the code that go to `/app`.

I always forget this command, but `web-ext run --verbose` is the easiest way to run after build (from app/ directory.).
