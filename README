# Cyberfeeder

This is a firefox extension that adds new scripts and stylesheet into jinteki.net.

The extension aims to be:
- Plug and playable.
- Mobile friendly (some day!)
- Good for reading board states intuitively.
- Easy to integrate into jnet.

# Bulid and test instructions
- Built with Fedora. Packages may vary in other distros.
- Install build dependencies: `sudo dnf install sass tsc npm nodejs web-ext`.
- Install Rustup to get cargo, and `cargo install toml2json`
- `nom install` to setup project
- `npm run build` to run the build script (build.sh)
- `cd` into `app` and Test using `web-ext run --verbose`
- go to `jinteki.net`, login, navigate to `Play`, and click `Load replay`, select the `replay.json` file in the root of the project and load a replay (attached as replay.json) and click `Start Replay`. Test the application as you see the replay. (you can use arrow keys to navigate game steps.)
